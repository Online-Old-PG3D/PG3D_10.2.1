PG3D 10.2.1 Online code / how to use it

 ## PolarmodsManager.cs
 Don't use if you don't need it.
 
 ## ClosingScript.cs
 In dnSpy, search for ClosingScript, after that, copy the contents of the script in this repo and paste it in the ClosingScript class.
 This patches the Green Screen Crash.
 
 ## MainMenuController.cs
 In dnSpy, search for MainMenuController, after that, copy the contents of the script in this repo and paste it in the MainMenuController class.
 This makes online work (combine this with the ClosingScript one and there will be no connection problems!).
